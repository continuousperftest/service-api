# API service for Continuous Perf Test


## Project structure

The project is organized around two features `dashboard` and `storage` by using ```PACKAGE BY FEATURE``` style.
The `dashboard` is in charge of providing UI application with data to render performance metrics whereas `storage` is responsible for storing performance metrics generated by tests and sent to storage by [agent](https://github.com/continuousperftest/agent-java).This organization style was applied to easily extract `dashboard` or `storage` if there is need to do that.
